# mini_blog
I am currently creating my PHP interview blog. Initially, my idea was to build it from scratch in PHP, then develop an application using the MVC/CMS template, and eventually migrate it to WordPress and then to Laravel. Currently, the blog is built on the WordPress platform, where I have created a custom theme called 'php_interview' and a plugin called 'ph-cookie-notify'.
